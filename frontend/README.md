## üß™ Testing the Frontend

### With Mock Data (Current State)
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a new account or use any credentials (authentication is mocked)
3. Explore all pages to see the UI and mock interactions
4. Note that data won't persist between sessions

### With Backend (Future State)
Once the backend is running:
1. Update the `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` to point to your backend
2. Ensure the backend is running with proper CORS configuration
3. Test real authentication, data persistence, and API interactions

## üé® UI Features

- **Theme Support**: Dark/Light mode toggle with fully theme-aware components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions using Framer Motion
- **Glass Morphism**: Modern translucent UI elements with backdrop blur effects
- **Gradient Effects**: Dynamic animated color gradients throughout
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Interactive Elements**: 
  - Animated post interaction buttons with gradient hover states
  - Thumbs-up animation when liking posts
  - Filled icon states for liked/saved posts
  - Full-width action buttons with visual dividers
- **Visual Polish**:
  - Reduced glass card opacity for better theme consistency
  - Minimal borders for sidebar components
  - Clean 404 page with animated gradient dots
  - Properly extending button dividers in post cards

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Data Persistence**: All data is lost on page refresh since backend is not connected
2. **Authentication**: Login/signup forms accept any input as there's no validation
3. **Profile Page Error**: Shows JSON parsing error due to missing backend endpoint
4. **Image Uploads**: File selection works but images aren't saved
5. **Real-time Updates**: Notifications and feed updates are static

### Temporary Behaviors
- **Mock Authentication**: Any username/password combination will log you in
- **Static Counts**: Follower/following numbers don't update
- **Sample Content**: Explore and Inbox show the same mock data for all users
- **No Search Results**: Search bars are UI-only, don't filter content

### Not Implemented (Awaiting Backend)
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification
- Real GitHub OAuth integration
- Post creation and persistence
- Comment system
- Direct messaging
- Node federation features
